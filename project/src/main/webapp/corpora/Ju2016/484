founded in 1808 as carlinaeur(tm)s settlement, franklin (named for benjamin franklin) became the parish seat in 1811 and the first incorporated town in 1820. though early settlers included french, acadian, german, danish and irish, the townaeur(tm)s culture and architecture is heavily influenced by the unusually large numbers of english that chose to settle there after the  purchase in 1803. numerous large sugar plantations arose in the area, and with the development of steamboating, franklin became an interior sugar port.
