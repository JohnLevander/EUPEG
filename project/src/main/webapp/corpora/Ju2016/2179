while oxford officially marks the year 1683 as its founding because in that year it was first named by the  general assembly as a seaport, the town began between 1666 and 1668 when 30 acres (120,000 m2) were laid out as a town called oxford by william stephens, jr.. by 1669 one of the first houses was built for innkeeper francis armstrong (see talbot county land records, a 1, f. 10/11).
