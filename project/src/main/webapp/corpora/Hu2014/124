Where we enjoy the company of our neighbors on summer nights, talking on the porch about the day's news and sports scores from the latest Pirate's game, until someone flips a coin to see who'll run out for BBQ. Walking through the streets of Greenville, you see it has its share of art galleries, museums and festivals that delight; or, close by, the campus of East Carolina University calls to art and culture lovers with its worldly offering of musical concerts, theatrical and dance productions, travel films and lectures.
